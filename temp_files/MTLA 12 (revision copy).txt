Producing and marketing a multimedia project is expensive. Multimedia projects require substantial up-front investments in both development costs and in the acquisition of the third-party rights that will be used in the product. Many multimedia manufacturers either lack the resources to singularly fund such products or look to others to participate and help share the cost and the attendant risk.

One way for many multimedia companies to raise the needed capital for such projects is through bank loans with third parties. Funding the project through a bank loan will preserve for the multimedia company the lion's share of the proceeds&mdash;assuming that there are proceeds. Should the project fail (and many do), the multimedia company will remain responsible to the bank or lending institution for the monies borrowed for the project. Most banks want security for the loan and take a security interest in certain assets of the company.

The commercial lending section of a bank will gladly loan monies to an established multimedia company to fund portions of a project. Most loans are documented with appropriate documents including notes and the like.

Depending on the assets of the borrower, some banks will seek collateral and/or a security interest in the eventual multimedia product for which the loan was made or in other assets of the multimedia company. This protects the bank in the event of a total failure of the company.

In this regard, the banks frequently will require that the company sign a security agreement on the closing of the loan that identifies the collateral the company will post for the loan <x>&sect;12:3</x>. The bank would then seek to perfect its security interest in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code. All appropriate steps should be taken under the Code to perfect such rights, including complying with all of the applicable filing requirements. Failure to fully perfect one's security interest can result in the loss of rights.

Intellectual property and entertainment attorneys have come to appreciate the applicability and importance of security interests in licensing transactions, particularly where one party is of questionable financial strength. (See generally pl.ref.id="I03DFM3">Battersby &amp; Grimes, “Security Interests in Licensing,” Licensing J. (Mar. 1989).)

Obtaining financing in order to purchase equipment, particularly computer hardware, often requires a company to obtain a loan from a lender. The loan agreement <x>&sect;12:7</x> spells out the specifics of the borrower's obligations to the lender, as well as the lender's rights in and to the collateral. The moneys advanced under the loan agreement may even be used to purchase equipment that is to be used by the lender.

Lending institutions often use an assignment, whether conditional or outright, of the borrower's collateral in order to further secure the obligations of the borrower. In the areas of multimedia and technology, this collateral generally takes the form of the intellectual property of the borrower. Trademarks, patents, and copyrights are valuable properties whose value is often unappreciated by their owners.
</para.text>
</para>
<para ct.id="093098c0cf3911efb63af356d531020f|1|12:1">
<para.text>
In the case of conditional assignments, the collateral for the loan remains in the possession of the borrower. The secured party can take possession of the collateral only upon a default by the borrower of the security agreement. When dealing with intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, the secured party takes possession of the collateral with an assignment of the property (and any good will associated therewith, in the case of trademarks) from the borrower to the secured party. Such a method differs from the situation in which the lender actually acquires the rights in the collateral with a license-back to the original owner. With a conditional assignment, the original owner (the borrower) retains full title to the collateral subject to a security interest and lien by the secured party. The secured party acquires the collateral only in the event of a default by the original borrower.

<para ct.id="093098c0cf3911efb63af356d531020f|1|12:1">
<para.text>
The language for the conditional assignment is similar to that of the outright assignment and license back in that both agreements state that the borrower is unconditionally granting to the secured party, as collateral for the payment, performance and satisfaction of its obligations under the security agreement, a continuing security interest in and first priority lien on the collateral. However, in a conditional assignment, the borrower's grant to the secured party of its entire right, title, and interest in and to the collateral is conditioned on the provision that such grant becomes of force and effect only upon default or upon the sale or other disposition of or foreclosure upon the collateral.

Secured parties often grant to an intellectual property lawyer or lawyers a power of attorney to take all appropriate steps to maintain the intellectual property rights in and to the collateral. Such steps include maintaining the trademark, copyright, and patent registrations in order to avoid abandonment as well as seeking additional registrations and filing the necessary affidavits of use and renewals.

<para.text>
Although not necessarily required for all types of intellectual property, filing a notice of security interest <x>&sect;12:5</x> serves as evidence of the secured party's security interest and notice to all subsequent creditors. Such a notice is primarily for recordation purposes, and should contain a specific itemization of all collateral covered by the security agreement, in the event that the borrower attempts to secure another loan with the same collateral, or conversely if the borrower desires to obtain another loan using different collateral. Although a secured party need not record a security interest in trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, such a practice is highly recommended. A security interest in copyrights, however, should be registered with the Register of Copyrights in order for the secured party to perfect its interest therein.

Upon the borrower's performance and satisfaction of its obligations under the security agreement, in particular the payment of the monies owed, the collateral once again becomes the property of the borrower, free and clear of all security interests or liens. A notice of the release of the secured party's interest in the collateral <x>&sect;12:6</x> should also be filed with the appropriate agency.

In addition to identifying the product inventory as the collateral covered by this agreement, the bank has also included all intellectual property rights in the property (including the rights under all license agreements), as well as the advertising material. The bank has recognized that a multimedia product is not simply the product itself, but the collection of valuable rights that make up the product.

This recites the heart of the issue, i.e., upon a default in the Security Agreement, the banks may take possession of the trademarks. Thus, this differs from a situation in which the lender actually acquires the rights in the marks with a license-back to the original trademark owner. In this instance, the original trademark owner retains full title to the marks subject to a security interest and lien by the banks. Thus, the banks only acquire the marks in the event of a default by the original trademark owner/borrower.

It is important to carefully and clearly identify the marks involved. The better practice is to do this by schedule, particularly where many marks are involved. This same schedule will form the basis of any necessary filings with the Patent and Trademark Office and other governmental bodies. Similarly, it is important to not only include those marks currently in existence and use but marks that may be adopted in the future. Finally, the provision should also include those trademarks that are licensed into the company, e.g., Mickey Mouse, etc., that are not owned but are being used under license from third parties.

Negotiation Point: Care, however, should be taken with regard to such licensed marks as the granting of a security interest in such licensed marks can be violative of the provisions of the license agreement. For example, most merchandising license agreements specifically prohibit assignments of the agreement. As such, consenting to this provision can potentially put the borrower in a potential breach situation with both parties.
