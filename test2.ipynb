The chief provisions proposed for the bylaws should be indicated and the form of the marketing agreement to be used should be set forth.\\n ►<field>p.ct.id=\"6d0bf250b92611ef8747b569df12a67d|9|32:9\"</field>New York statutory law specifies the matters required to be included in the certificate of incorporation of a cooperative corporation.3 These requirements are set out in a subsequent checklist.4 The certificate should specify that the organization will deal only in agricultural products, as defined in ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I05PANM\"</field>Sections 110 to 113 of the New York Cooperative Corporations Law,5 and should make clear that the organization will qualify as an agricultural cooperative within the meaning of the statute.6 &ldquo;“Agricultural product&rdquo;” is defined as any product of cultivating land, and includes floricultural, horticultural, viticultural, forestry, nut, dairy, livestock, poultry, bee, and any farm products or by-products thereof.7 An &ldquo;“agricultural cooperative&rdquo;” is a cooperative, either stock or nonstock, operated for the mutual benefit of the members in which no member is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he or she may own therein; the cooperative does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 12&percnt;% per year; and the cooperative does not deal in farm products, agricultural waste products or agricultural compost, farm supplies, farm business services and the capture of methane and other gases for the generation and use or sale of energy, with or for nonmembers in an amount greater in value than the total amount of such business transacted by it with or for members.8\\nPractice Tips:\\n ►<field>p.ct.id=\"6d0bf250b92611ef8747b569df12a67d|9|32:9\"</field>Because the certificate of incorporation of an agricultural cooperative association is generally more difficult to amend than its bylaws,9 it is recommended that the substantive content of the certificate be limited to the statutory requirements.10\\n ►<field>p.ct.id=\"6d0bf250b92611ef8747b569df12a67d|9|32:9\"</field>In general, the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law applies to agricultural cooperative corporations except where such provisions are in conflict with or are inconsistent with the particular provisions applicable to cooperatives.11\\n32:10.

For example, the bylaws of an agricultural marketing cooperative are often tied to a marketing agreement between the cooperative and its members. The bylaws frequently incorporate the agreement by reference and may specify the method to be used to create, accumulate, and maintain the reserves required by statute.7\\nB. Checklists\\n32:12.

Two kinds of agricultural co-ops qualify as &ldquo;“tax-exempt.&rdquo;” The term is placed in quotes for a reason. While these organizations are stated to be &ldquo;“exempt from taxation&rdquo;” under ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I05QQES\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &ss;§§521, farmers\\' cooperatives are still required to be pay taxes specified in ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I05NX9W\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &s;§ 1381 et seq.,26 U.S.C.A. &s;§ 1381 then requires them to pay the ordinary income tax and capital gains tax levied by. 26 U.S.C.A. &s;§&s;§ 11 and 1201. Section 1381 then goes on to say that in spite of these taxes being levied against agricultural cooperatives, they are considered to be exempt from income taxes for any purpose in which the law refers to exempt organizations.\\n ►<field>p.ct.id=\"6d0bf250b92611ef8747b569df12a67d|17|32:17\"</field>The two types of agricultural cooperatives that are recognized are the marketing co-op and the purchasing co-op.

Otherwise, they pay tax under the regular rules that relate to ordinary income and capital gain.

That demonstrates that the purpose of the entity is to meet the tax requirements and makes easier its claim to the specialized tax treatment afforded by the Internal Revenue Code. As an example, the key to allowance of the patronage dividend exclusion is a pre-existing enforceable obligation of the co-op to distribute its patronage earnings among its patrons. ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I049425\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &s;§1388(a)(2).

That demonstrates that the purpose of the entity is to meet the tax requirements and makes easier its claim to the specialized tax treatment afforded by the Internal Revenue Code. As an example, the key to allowance of the patronage dividend exclusion is a pre-existing enforceable obligation of the co-op to distribute its patronage earnings among its patrons. ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I049425\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &s;§1388(a)(2).

That demonstrates that the purpose of the entity is to meet the tax requirements and makes easier its claim to the specialized tax treatment afforded by the Internal Revenue Code. As an example, the key to allowance of the patronage dividend exclusion is a pre-existing enforceable obligation of the co-op to distribute its patronage earnings among its patrons. ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I09SME0\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &s;§1388(a)(2). Listing this in the bylaws not only shows that the corporation plans to do this but also makes it a pre-existing obligation of the corporation. If this should not be covered elsewhere, it nevertheless provides compliance with the Code.\\n \\n ►<field>p.ct.id=\"6d0bf250b92611ef8747b569df12a67d|24|32:24\"</field>Cooperative corporations may issue either stock (as in these bylaws) or membership shares.

That demonstrates that the purpose of the entity is to meet the tax requirements and makes easier its claim to the specialized tax treatment afforded by the Internal Revenue Code. As an example, the key to allowance of the patronage dividend exclusion is a pre-existing enforceable obligation of the co-op to distribute its patronage earnings among its patrons. ►<field>st.ref.id=\"I049425\"</field>26 U.S.C.A. &s;§1388(a)(2).
