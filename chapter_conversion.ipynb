      " \tCooperative corporations are distinguished from other business structures by the features of democratic control and voting, the distribution of economic benefits on an equal basis or in proportion to the use made of the corporation facilities, limited return on capital, and the fact that most of the cooperative's business is done with its own members.3 It should be noted that federal legislation authorizing associations of agricultural producers applies only to corporations that, inter alia, allow only one vote per member, or that do not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 12&percnt;% per year.

Organizations operating under this type of statutory provision are generally exempt from prosecution for certain actions that might otherwise be considered as being in restraint of trade.2\n",

      " \tUnlike other nonspecific types of cooperative organizations, an agricultural cooperative is defined with precision by the Code, regulations, rulings, and cases. Two kinds of agricultural co-ops qualify as &ldquo;“tax-exempt.&rdquo;” The term is placed in quotes for a reason. While these organizations are stated to be &ldquo;“exempt from taxation&rdquo;” under 26 U.S.C.A. &ss;§§521, farmers' cooperatives are still required to be pay taxes specified in 26 U.S.C.A. &s;§ 1381 et seq.,26 U.S.C.A. &s;§ 1381 then requires them to pay the ordinary income tax and capital gains tax levied by. 26 U.S.C.A. &s;§&s;§ 11 and 1201. Section 1381 then goes on to say that in spite of these taxes being levied against agricultural cooperatives, they are considered to be exempt from income taxes for any purpose in which the law refers to exempt organizations.\n",
      " \tThe two types of agricultural cooperatives that are recognized are the marketing co-op and the purchasing co-op. The requirements for these organizations are found at 26 U.S.C.A. &s;§521(b)(1), (4).\n",
      " \tThe result is that an agricultural cooperative is entitled to a special deduction for patronage dividends, dividends on capital stock, and certain other distributions. Otherwise, they pay tax under the regular rules that relate to ordinary income and capital gain. They are not permitted the dividends-received deduction and may not use the consolidated return provisions. 26 C.F.R. &s;§1.522-1(a).\n",

That demonstrates that the purpose of the entity is to meet the tax requirements and makes easier its claim to the specialized tax treatment afforded by the Internal Revenue Code. As an example, the key to allowance of the patronage dividend exclusion is a pre-existing enforceable obligation of the co-op to distribute its patronage earnings among its patrons. 26 U.S.C.A. &s;§1388(a)(2).

      " \tIn New York, specific statutory provisions authorize marketing contracts between a cooperative corporation and its members, under which the members are required to sell all or any specified portion of any product or specified commodity exclusively to or through the corporation or facilities created by the corporation.1 Such contracts may obligate the members during any designated period of time, subject to the right of each member to be released at a designated period in each year, by giving a prescribed notice.2 These contracts are expressly declared not to be illegal or in restraint of trade.3\n",
      " \tThe state laws relating to the restraint and prevention of monopolies do not apply to cooperative associations, corporate or otherwise, of farmers, gardeners, or dairymen, including livestock farmers and fruit growers, or to contracts, agreements, or arrangements made by such associations.4\n",
      " \tPersons engaged in the production of agricultural products may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing in interstate or foreign commerce products of persons so engaged.5 Such corporations and their members are further authorized to make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect these purposes.6 However, these corporations are subject to requirements that they be operated for the members' mutual benefit, that they do not deal in the products of nonmembers to an amount greater in value than the amount handled for members, that no member of the corporation be allowed more than one vote regardless of the amount of stock or membership capital he or she may own in the corporation, and that the corporations do not pay dividends on stock or membership in excess of 12&percnt;% per year.7\n",
      " \tThe marketing contract may provide that the corporation may sell or resell the products delivered by its members, with or without taking title to such products, and may pay over to its members the resale price or the pool price, in case of pooling of sales, after deducting all necessary selling, overhead, and other costs and expenses, including interest or distribution on stock, not exceeding 6&percnt;% per year, and any other deductions authorized by the bylaws or marketing contract.8\n",
      " \tThe marketing agreement may fix specific sums as liquidated damages, which sums will not be regarded as penalties, payable for breach by a member or shareholder or contracting nonmember of the marketing obligation.9 A provision of this type may also be placed in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws.10\n",
      " \tIt may be further provided that a member or shareholder will pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees in case the corporation recovers judgment in any action on the marketing contract.11 A corporation is also given the right, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of a marketing contract by a member or by a contracting nonmember, to enjoin further breach of the contract and to obtain a decree of specific performance to enforce the contract.12 Upon the filing of a verified complaint showing a breach of the marketing agreement and of a bond approved by the court, the corporation is entitled to a temporary restraining order.13\n",

      " \tTo be effective, a marketing contract must satisfy such basic requirements of all contracts as competent parties who express definite assent in the form required, sufficient consideration, and a legal object or purpose.1\n",
      " \tA marketing contract, due to its complexity, should always be in writing and should observe formalities that are often omitted in the simpler forms of contract. Because such contracts are construed strictly, extreme care should be taken to avoid any ambiguities in the contract's provisions.2\n",
      "Practice Tip:\n",
      " \tMarketing contracts are sometimes attached to preorganization agreements in order that they may be signed by prospective members prior to incorporation of the cooperative. In such circumstances, the marketing agreement is executed contemporaneously by the prospective member with the execution of the organization agreement and as a part of the entire contract.\n",
      " \tMarketing contracts entered into prior to the formation of a producers' marketing corporation are valid and binding upon the producers as signers after the formation of the corporation.3\n",
      "Practice Tip:\n",
      " \tA cooperative marketing agreement may create either of two relationships with respect to the products to be marketed under it: (1) a relationship of buyer and seller (a sales contract); or (2) the relationship of principal and agent between the member and the association (an agency contract). The nature of the relationship and the type of contract created depends upon the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the provisions of the contract, and as viewed in the light of the articles of incorporation or charter, the bylaws, and the circumstances of the particular case, including applicable statutory provisions.4\n",

This right may be exercised at any time although Packer has accepted delivery from Corporation members after such default or failure in the performance of any of its obligations under this contract.

Corporation may also be held liable to Packer for damages suffered as a result of the default.\n",
      "25. SERVICE CHARGE\n",
