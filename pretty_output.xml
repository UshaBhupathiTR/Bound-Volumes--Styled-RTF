When hauled into federal court, state actors undoubtedly want qualified immunity at the earliest possible stage. But how soon is too soon? We consider in this interlocutory appeal whether to deny a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds where the complaint is sufficiently detailed to state a claim for a constitutional violation but not specific enough to assess whether the right was clearly established at the time it was allegedly violated.

In spring 2020, Plaintiffs Martha and Paul Stringer received news that any parent would dread: Their daughter, Kimberly, who had long struggled with severe mental illness, had been detained after an altercation with a neighbor and was being mistreated by the staff of the Bucks County Correctional Facility (BCCF), where she was being held. After Kimberly was finally transferred to a mental hospital and then released, the Stringers sued the County of Bucks and various BCCF corrections officers on Kimberly's behalf,

    We agree. While the Stringers' complaint states a claim for a violation of a constitutional right, namely, Kimberly's right to be free from the use of excessive force, it is not sufficiently detailed to enable the Court to define that right with more specificity and then assess whether that right was clearly established, as required for qualified immunity. Because the District Court correctly determined that Defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity is not clear from the face of the complaint, we will affirm and remand for limited discovery as needed for a fact-specific qualified immunity analysis.

Kimberly Stringer has long struggled with mental illness, including bipolar disorder. In the spring of 2020, her mental health deteriorated further, and her "worsening paranoia" led her to hit and threaten a neighbor. App. 78.

At BCCF, Kimberly suffered greatly. According to the amended complaint (Complaint), even though Kimberly's mental illness rendered her unable to comply with prison directives, Defendants "punished" her on multiple occasions for her noncompliance by pepper spraying her, handcuffing her, and placing her in a restraint chair. The Complaint asserts that Defendants used a combination of these tactics not once, but many times, including, at a minimum, on May 6, 10, 11,

At no time, according to the Complaint, did Kimberly pose a threat to the guards or other inmates, nor could she have, as she allegedly deteriorated into a catatonic state over the course of her detention. Even as her condition became so severe that she was moved to a cell in the Women's Special Housing Unit for Mental Health Inmates, Defendants allegedly continued to pepper spray and restrain her as punishment for noncompliance with their directives.

Kimberly's mother, Martha, promptly emailed the Bucks County Commissioner to ask if her daughter had faced pepper spray, but she was assured that was not the case. Two days later, however, a news article was published about Kimberly's treatment, allegedly based on firsthand accounts of inmates who had witnessed her ordeal. Two days after that public disclosure, Kimberly was transferred to Norristown State Mental Hospital. By that point, however, she allegedly had suffered pain, disfigurement, and possible brain damage and was "cat[at]onic," "unable to verbally communicate[,] and nearly entirely unresponsive." App. 84.

            The Complaint alleges that Sergeants Morris, Lynn, Mason, Kovach, Wylie, and Mander, the supervisors at the jail who authorized the use of force against Kimberly, knew that Kimberly was unable to comply with directives from the guards because of her mental illness—though it is unclear when they became aware of these facts. It does not specifically allege knowledge on the part of the other Defendants. That, too, will require factual development on remand because, while excessive force claims and qualified immunity defense are evaluated under an objective reasonableness standard, see Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 396–97 (2015); Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 151 (2017), "deciding whether a use of force was objectively reasonable demands 'careful attention to the facts and circumstances' relating to the incident, as then known to the officer." Barnes v. Felix, 145 S. Ct. 1353, 1358 (2025) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989)); see Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 397 (evaluating alleged excessive force "from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, including what the officer knew at the time, not with the 20/20 vision of hindsight").

                     The Court determined that, because the Stringers' amended claims related back to their initial complaint, it would not dismiss the newly named defendants for the Stringers' failure to file within the relevant statute of limitations. In addition, the Court declined to dismiss the excessive force and supervisory liability claims against all individual Defendants other than Defendant Mander, against whom the Stringers' supervisory liability claim was dismissed. The Court dismissed the municipal liability claim against Bucks County because the Stringers did not plead facts showing either that the County had a "custom or policy" of authorizing the use of excessive force on mentally ill prisoners or that the County failed to adequately train or supervise its employees.

Defendants contest the District Court's denial of qualified immunity on several different grounds. Below we first set out the framework for analyzing qualified immunity at the pleading stage before turning to Defendants arguments, specifically that (1) the lack of factual details in the Complaint entitled them to immunity, (2) the District Court erred in denying their request for immunity as "premature" without fully analyzing the clearly established prong, and (3) the District Court should have made specific qualified immunity determinations for each individual Defendant, even at the pleading stage.

To be sure, the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis—whether the facts alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right—fits like a glove at the motion-to-dismiss stage because it overlaps with a district court's inquiry under Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6).

            The Court determined that, because the Stringers' amended claims related back to their initial complaint, it would not dismiss the newly named defendants for the Stringers' failure to file within the relevant statute of limitations. In addition, the Court declined to dismiss the excessive force and supervisory liability claims against all individual Defendants other than Defendant Mander, against whom the Stringers' supervisory liability claim was dismissed. The Court dismissed the municipal liability claim against Bucks County because the Stringers did not plead facts showing either that the County had a "custom or policy" of authorizing the use of excessive force on mentally ill prisoners or that the County failed to adequately train or supervise its employees.

            To be sure, before ruling on the motion to dismiss, a district court has discretion to order the plaintiff to reply to the qualified immunity defense under Rule 7(a)(7) or grant a defendant's motion for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e).

Defendants' second argument is simply the flip side of the same coin. They challenge the District Court's conclusion that the clearly established inquiry was premature and that the Court was "obligated" to conduct a "[f]ull," detailed qualified immunity analysis before denying their motion to dismiss. Opening Br. 17, 19. That argument, however, conflates the standard for dismissal at the pleading stage with that at summary judgment.

Why was she pepper-sprayed and for how long? What prior knowledge of her condition did each Defendant have when they took the alleged actions? Put simply, Defendants' immunity defense cannot be resolved without some discovery, so the District Court properly denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss and indicated it would consider qualified immunity at summary judgment.
